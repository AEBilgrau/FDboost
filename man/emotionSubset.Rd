\title{EEG and EMG recordings in a computerised gambling study}
\description{
  
   To analyse the functional relationship between electroencephalography (EEG) and facial electromyography (EMG), Gentsch et al. (2014) simultaneously recorded EEG and EMG signals from 24 participants while they were playing a computerised gambling task. The given subset contains aggregated observations of 23 participants. Curves were averaged over each subject and each of the 8 study settings, resulting in 23 times 8 curves.

\details{
  The aim is to explain potentials in the EMG signal by study settings as well as
  the EEG signal (see Ruegamer et al., 2016).
